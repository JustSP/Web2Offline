# Web2Offline

Fast and stable website downloader for offline viewing. Unlike most other applications in this category, this one is built ground-up on .NET Framework 4.6. Light-weight Windows Form based for simple and quick distribution and highly scalable.


## Stable - 1.0

This release focuses on bare-bone functionality of downloading a site with all dependencies.


## What you should expect

You should be able to view the selected / downloaded website in your browser offline. Few pages may be broken with respect to following
1. Fontawesome or specialized font dependencies may not work (work in progress)
2. Background images wrapped under special attributes of HTML elements may not work (ex. data-image or row-data-image, etc.)

Works only with **HTML** websites.


## For Issues
